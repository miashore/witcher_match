# Memory Match - Version 0.5 (v0.5)
=======
# Memory Match

### Overview

> Version 1.0 continues where version 0.5 stopped by adding in the statistics of the memory match game. When a user clicks on a card the application will start tracking how many matches versus how many attempts. In combination with the stats there is also a tracker for how many times the game is played. Games played is tracked by resetting / restarting the game.

#### Scope

> - Create 4 card static layout by removing 7 of the nine matching cards
> - Add a click handler to each card by 1 of these 2 methods
>   - jQuery - Intermediate
>       - Add click method to a jQuery Selector with the parameter equal to a function called card_clicked
>   - onclick attribute - Fundamentals
>       - the value of the attribute on each element should be set to card_clicked with a parameter of the keyword this
> - Declare and assign 3 global (see scope presentation) variables
>   - **first_card_clicked** assigned to null
>   - **second_card_clicked** assigned to null
>   - **total_possible_matches** assign to number of total possible matches (in this case 2)
>   - **match_counter** assigned to 0
> - Declare card_clicked function in the script.js file with the following functionality in it
>   - Show the card face
>   - Check if variable first_card_clicked is null
>       - **true** - assign first_card_clicked equal to the html DOM Element that was clicked
>           - click handler functionality is complete, return
>       - **false** - assign second_card_clicked to the html DOM Element that was clicked
>           - check if first_card_clicked is equivalent to the second_card_clicked
>               - **true**
>                   - increment match_counter by 1
>                   - reset both variables defined above to null again and then wait for next card click
>                   - check if match_counter is equivalent to total_possible_matches
>                       - **true**
>                           - Display a message to the user they have won

>                           - click handler functionality is complete, return
>               - **false**
>                   - Wait 2 seconds then
>                       - Be wary of waiting programmatically but not being able to control the user from clicking on cards while the program waits execute the reset of the code
>                       - Show card back on both elements that are flipped over
>                       - reset both card_clicked

### Scope

>- Adding Stats
    - Declare a global variable, `matches`, and set it to 0
        - Every time the application finds a match this variable should be incremented by 1
    - Declare a global variable, `attempts`, and set it to 0
        - Every time a user attempts a match (clicks the 2nd card) the attempts should be incremented by 1
    - Declare a global variable, `accuracy`, and set it to 0
        - Accuracy is defined as a percentage of matches / attempts
    - Declare a global variable, `games_played` and set it to 0
        - When the page is loaded a new global variable should be defined called games_played. When the game is reset by clicking the reset button the games_played should be incremented by 1.
    - Declare a function, `display_stats`, that has the following functionality
        - Inserts the **games_played** value into the element that would be selected like this “.games-played .value”
        - Insert **attempts** value into the element that would be selected using this selector “.attempts .value”
        - Formats **accuracy** to be a percentage number with the **%** sign
        - Takes formatted **accuracy** and inserts the value of the variable into the element that has the selector of “.accuracy .value”
    - Declare a function, `reset_stats`, that has the following functionality
        - Resets variable **accuracy** to 0
        - Resets variable **matches** to 0
        - Resets variable **attempts** to 0
        - Calls **display_stats** function
    - On **Reset button** click, the function handler for the click event should have the following functionality
        - increment games_played by 1
        - call reset_stats
        - call display_stats
        - Reset all cards to have the back face showing
